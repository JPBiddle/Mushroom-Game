# Matching Mushrooms

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2

Matching Mushrooms is a memory mini game designed to train the users memory to improve cognitave performance while also being an enjoyable, whimsical yet competitive game. 

The game is designed to be simple in nature, as the user is advised to focus on the memory part of the game and therefore simple is better - to avoid distractions.

This was the second Milestone Projects as part of my course at the Code Institute. The main requirements were to make an interactive and responsive website with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

## UX

### Ideal Users

The aim for me is to create a website that appeals to:

- New users
- Current users

### User Stories
#### New Users 

- As a new user, I want to find instructions on how to use the site easily.
- As a new user, I want the game to be engaging, beautifully designed and visually attractive.
- As a new user, I want to be able to navigate through the website easily.

#### Current Users

- As a current user, I want to be able to see my score from the game I just played at least.
- As a current user, I want to be able to play the game more than once and have a different experience the second time.
- As a current user, I want to have the option of playing the game with different difficulty settings.
