# Matching Mushrooms

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2

Matching Mushrooms is a memory mini game designed to train the users memory to improve cognitave performance while also being an enjoyable, whimsical yet competitive game. 

The game is designed to be simple in nature, as the user is advised to focus on the memory part of the game and therefore simple is better - to avoid distractions.

This was the second Milestone Projects as part of my course at the Code Institute. The main requirements were to make an interactive and responsive website with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
